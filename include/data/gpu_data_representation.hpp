 * directly passed to cuDF APIs for processing without any additional copying while the underlying
 * memory is still owned/tracked by our memory allocator.

 * TODO: Once the GPU memory resource is implemented, replace the allocation type from
 * IAllocatedMemory to the concrete type returned by the GPU memory allocator.
